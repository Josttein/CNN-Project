\startsubject[title=Introduction]
In this paper we are going to give an introduction to the mechanics of {\em convolutional} neural networks.
Our first obejective is to outline the most important concepts in machine learning.
Building upon these concepts, we are going to show the underlying mathematical equations which govern the operation of a convolutional nerual network.
Included in that section will be and answer as to why it is that convolutional neural networks are named so.
Finally we show and implimentation of a convolutional neural network from scratch using nothing but Python with the NumPy library.
